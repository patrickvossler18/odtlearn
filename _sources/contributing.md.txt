# How to contribute to ODTlearn
Welcome! This document covers different ways you can contribute to ODTlearn.

## Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [ODTlearn code of conduct](https://github.com/D3M-Research-Group/odtlearn/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Improve the documentation

The docs are written in Markdown and are built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). You can find the source for the docs [here](https://github.com/D3M-Research-Group/odtlearn/tree/main/docs).

If your change is small (like fixing typos, or one or two sentence corrections), the easiest way to do this is via GitHub's online editor. (GitHub has [help](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) on how to do this.)

If your change is larger, or touches multiple files, you will need to make the change locally and then use Git to submit a pull request.

## File a bug report
Another way to contribute to ODTlearn is to [file bug reports](https://github.com/D3M-Research-Group/odtlearn/issues/new/choose).

Please make sure to read the info in the boxes where you write the body of the issue before posting. We also recommend reading [this StackOverflow help page on reproducible examples](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to help ensure that your issue is resolved in a timely manner.
